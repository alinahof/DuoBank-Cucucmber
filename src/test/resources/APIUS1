  Feature: API User Story 1 for API endpoint testing

    @API
    Scenario: The API should require a authentication key for access
      Given The base uri is set
      And "Accept" header is set to "application/json"
      And "x-api-key" header is set to "c8a912d7d1c5a5a99c508f865b5eaae14a5b484f5bfe2d8f48c40e46289b47f3"
      When I send a "GET" request to endpoint "/api/users"

      @API
      Scenario: The API should have fields in the body of the JSON
        Given The base uri is set
        And "Accept" header is set to "application/json"
        And "x-api-key" header is set to "c8a912d7d1c5a5a99c508f865b5eaae14a5b484f5bfe2d8f48c40e46289b47f3"
        When I send a "GET" request to endpoint "/api/users"
        Then you verify that the JSON has following fileds
          | id          |
          | email       |
          | first_name  |
          | last_name   |
          | phone       |
          | image       |
          | type        |
          | created_at  |
          | modified_at |
          | zone_id     |
          | church_id   |
          | active      |

      @API
        Scenario: The API should complete a request under 500ms
          Given The base uri is set
        And "Accept" header is set to "application/json"
          And "x-api-key" header is set to "c8a912d7d1c5a5a99c508f865b5eaae14a5b484f5bfe2d8f48c40e46289b47f3"
          When I send a "GET" request to endpoint "/api/user?id=12"
          And response time should be less than 500 ms

        @API
          Scenario: The API should allow you to choose the amount of results on the request
            Given The base uri is set
          And "Accept" header is set to "application/json"
            And "x-api-key" header is set to "c8a912d7d1c5a5a99c508f865b5eaae14a5b484f5bfe2d8f48c40e46289b47f3"
            When I send a "GET" request to endpoint "/api/users"
            And "pages" query Parameter is set to "2"
            And response time should be less than 500 ms
